When you initialize a repository, it adds a .git file to the directory. 
This needs to be done so that the metadata for tracking file history can be stored somewhere. 

The working directory contains the files in question. 
When the repository is created, it has the files from the working directory. 
However, it contains a .git file in addition. 
The staging area serves as an in-between.
You can take files from the working directory and put them in the staging area.
Then you can decide to make a commit containing those files.
