You want to use a remote repository to show other people your work. 

You want to pull changes manually because you may not want to update GitHub necessarily each time. 

A branch is a label for a series of commits. 
A clone is when you make a copy of a repository locally. 
A fork is when you make a copy of a repository on GitHub. 

Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is beneficial. 
It allows you to make edits that can be pushed back onto GitHub. 

Without using Git and GitHub, I would probably use email exchanges to collaborate. 
Doing this would be easier because it is relatively simple to do. 
However, it would also complicate things when people make changes and there are multiple versions. 
It is also harder to keep track of these changes. It is easy to get confused.
